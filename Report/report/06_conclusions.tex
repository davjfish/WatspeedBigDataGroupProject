\section{Conclusions}



\subsection{Future Development}


 Scratch ideas:

 - it would be great to handle the ingestion the csv data using async, maybe something like celery where it can happen in the background
- database routers
- metadata fields such as created_at and created_by
- sqlite not acceptable to use in a production environment. What would we use? "---this is suitable of a proof of concept however this would not be an acceptable tool to use in a production environment."


a discussion about the parser classes and how they can be called in the context of uploading a CSV or a web scrapper that is interacting with an API for an outside system


it would probably make sense to put a lot of investment in the rest api to maximize interoperability between systems

one drawback is what happens if the data schema from a source changes.
